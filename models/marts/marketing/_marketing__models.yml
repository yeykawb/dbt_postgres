    description: The dbt model 'people' is a tool that organizes and analyzes user
      data. It tracks whether a user's account is active, the number of times they've
      logged in, the length of their name, and the last time their data was updated.
      This model can be used to understand user behavior, such as how often they log
      in and if there's a correlation between name length and login frequency. This
      information can help in making data-driven decisions, like tailoring user engagement
      strategies.
